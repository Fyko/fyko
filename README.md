I'm a software engineer based in Denver, Colorado! I have the most experience with [`TypeScript`] but I'm not opposed for using the right tool for the job. I have *some* experience with [`C#`], plenty with [`Go`], and I hope to learn [`Python`], [`Elixir`] and [`Ocaml`]. Recently I've been writing a lot of [`Rust`]!

## My Background
I wrote my first line of code on November 19th, 2018. I was bored on Thanksgiving holiday and decided to try and write a a Discord bot with [`discord.js`]. With zero clue what I was doing, I put my head down and buried myself in the project â€“â€“ only to get it working a couple days later. About a year later, after plenty of learning, tinkering and growing, I opened my first company, [Sycer Development], selling custom Discord bots to some of the biggest players and communities in the sneaker reselling community. Though I closed her down almost two years ago, I owe a lot of my success to the folks that gave me a shot and helped me grow.

## What about now?
Since July of 2022, I've been working with [Truffle], a startup focused on filling the gaps left by Twitch and YouTube â€“â€“ improving live-streaming and content creation for both creators and their viewers.

Recently (edited: September 2023), some of my projects at Truffle include:
- [Chuckle], our in-house Discord bot for our internal company server
- [Scyllax], a Rust-based query framework (but also kinda? an ORM) for [Scylla]
- Hypha, a thin gRPC layer between our [Scylla] cluster and other services, standardizing our data access layer (utilizing [Scyllax])

## How to reach me
I'm most active on [Discord]. If you ever want to get in contact with me, join [my Discord server].
