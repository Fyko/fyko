I'm a software engineer based in Arvada, Colorado! I'm most experienced with [`TypeScript`], but recently I've been enjoying [`Rust`]! I have *some* experience with [`C#`], plenty with [`Go`], and I want to learn [`Elixir`] and [`C++`]!

## What I do (for fun)
I have a strong background in developing with the Discord API and maintain bots for others and myself. My largest bot, [Thoth](https://github.com/Fyko/thoth), is a great English language tool for students and folks who want to search definitions and various types of speech for fun!  

Often times, a random idea comes to me, or I want to learn a new technology, or I need a solution for a real-life problem and I just build it. My GitHub repositories page is a perfect timeline and archive of things I've wanted or needed to do. Here are a few of my funky projects:  

- [Wordle Stats](https://github.com/Fyko/wordle-stats) - before Elon bought Twitter, this bot listened to all Tweets containing the word `Wordle`, parsed the player's score, then served public visualizations on Grafana. I build this to see how many other people shared their scores and to get back into writing Rust.
- [AmbientWeather.net Data Collector](https://github.com/Fyko/ambient-weather-collector) - for Father's Day, I got my dad a weather station! It transmits data to AmbientWeather.net, and whenever it does, AW.net sends the updated data via a realtime API to this collector. The data is fed into ClickHouse and viewed realtime and in historical contexts. I built this because I wanted to know the exact temperature outside, with wind chill, before deciding to go in the hot tub.
- [crates.pm](https://github.com/sycertech/crates.pm) - the official https://crates.io website has text-search, but its not instant. I built\* crates.pm to index Crates and feed the data into [Meilisearch] to provide instant text search -- a service I wanted to learn more about.

## What I do (professionally)

I work at [Truffle], a startup focused on filling the gaps left by Twitch and YouTube, improving live-streaming and content creation for both creators and their viewers.  

Some of my projects at Truffle include:
- Upgrading [Scylla] to 6.0 and improving our backups system
- [Scyllax], a Rust-based query framework (but also kinda? an ORM) for Scylla
- Hypha, a thin gRPC layer between our Scylla cluster and other services, standardizing our data access layer (utilizing Scyllax)
- Kubernetes cluster maintenance
